h1. BrowserPlus ScreenReader Detection

This service is designed to query the users system and determine if a screen reader is active.

If it is active it will return the name and version of the active process.

h3. Working

Currently works on OSX picking up VoiceOver

It now filters for Windows Executibles:

* Jfw.exe -- JAWS For Windows screen reader.
* wineyes.exe -- Window-eyes screen reader.
* nvda.exe -- NVDA scree nreader.
* zt.exe -- Zoomtext screen magnifier.


h3. TODO

Still need to get the version info from the executibles on Windows.

h3. INSTALL

Check the README under src/service
